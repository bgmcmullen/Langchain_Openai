Our Story
THE FOUNDERS OF BRIDGING TECH

We are two young women from Stanford University who share a passion for achieving educational equity to improve social justice. When the COVID-19 pandemic put the world on pause, we came together to advocate for technology equity and help children affected by homelessness rise from poverty. Thankfully, many of our fellow students felt the same way, and we were able to surround ourselves with the brightest and most dedicated changemakers around.

Our respective experiences shaped the organization we built from the ground up. Isabel's early involvement in race relations and public health initiatives focused on educational equity informed her passion for improving social justice through community engagement. Margot's experiences volunteering at a women's homeless shelter in the Bay Area opened her eyes to the challenges created by a lack of access to technology in this tech-driven world. Combining our knowledge, we crafted a nonprofit that not only addresses the need for technology access in children's development, but also improves educational equity and life outcomes for the students we serve.

Our journey to understand generational cycles of inequity motivated us to get involved in bridging the digital divide on a deeper level. We constantly aim to positively impact the lives of the children we serve, so we started tutoring and mentorship programs to help our students navigate their paths toward higher education or job placement.

​By providing school-aged children with laptops for learning, we are helping students access the resources they need to fully interact with our technological world both during and after the pandemic.
